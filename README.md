# ☕ Coffee-Shop-Daily-Revenue
This project builds a regression model to predict the daily revenue of a coffee shop based on various operational features such as customer count, average order value, marketing spend, and foot traffic. Using a dataset from Kaggle, we explore the data, preprocess it, visualize patterns, and train a machine learning model to forecast revenue.
